Turn around Brake suddenly, Change to the right lane. Change to the left lane. Drive backwards, Accelerate and go ahead,\nSecond answer: In this scenario, the ego-vehicle is driving on a bridge with a lot of traffic, and it is important for the driver to avoid taking dangerous actions. Some dangerous actions to avoid include:\n\n1. Speeding: Driving at high speeds can increase the risk of accidents and collisions, especially on a bridge with multiple lanes and traffic.\n\n2. Sudden lane changes: Changing lanes abruptly or without signaling can cause confusion and increase the risk of accidents for other drivers.\n\n3. Ignoring traffic signals: Running red lights or stop signs can lead to collisions and endanger the lives of other road users.\n\n4. Tailgating: Following too closely behind other vehicles can cause accidents if the driver needs to stop suddenly or if the vehicle in front of them suddenly changes lanes.\n\n5. Using mobile devices: Using a mobile phone while driving can distract the driver and increase the risk of accidents.\n\nBy avoiding these dangerous actions, the ego-vehicle driver can help ensure the safety of themselves and other road users on the bridge.\nExplanation: The second answer is not similar to the standard answer.

Drive backwards, Accelerate and go ahead.\nSecond answer: In this scenario, the ego-vehicle is driving on a snowy road with a lot of traffic, including cars and trucks. To avoid accidents and ensure safety, the ego-vehicle should take the following actions: 1. Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles: Keeping a safe distance from other vehicles helps prevent collisions and allows for more time to react to any sudden changes in traffic conditions. 2. Adjust speed according to road conditions: Slow down when driving on snowy roads, as the reduced traction and increased stopping distance can lead to accidents. 3. Use proper lighting: Ensure that the vehicle's lights are functioning correctly, including headlights, taillights, and brake lights. This helps other drivers see the ego-vehicle and increases visibility in low-light conditions. 4. Be prepared for sudden stops or changes in traffic: Keep an eye on the road ahead and be ready to react to any unexpected situations, such as sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. 5. Avoid distractions: Refrain from using mobile devices or engaging in other distracting activities while driving, as this can lead to reduced attention and increased risk of accidents. By following these guidelines, the ego-vehicle can minimize the risk of accidents and ensure a safer driving experience on the snowy road.\nExplanation: The second answer does not match the standard answer at all.
